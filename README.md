# notetaker

My assignment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

a note-taking application

that has a landing page with a link to a notes page
When I click on the link to the notes page,
then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column.  The empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text are in the right-hand column.
When I enter a new note title and the note’s text
then a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
When I click on the Save button then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.
If I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
then that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.
When I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.
